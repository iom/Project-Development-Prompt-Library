Stakeholders & Pain Points \n\nWho are the key stakeholders (e.g., users, implementers, funders)? \nWhat challenges or pain points do each of these groups experience? \nWhat outcomes matter most to each stakeholder group? \n3. Processes & Workflows \n\nWhat does the current process or workflow look like? \nWhere do inefficiencies, friction, or failure points occur? \nAre there gaps or overlaps between actors and systems? \n4. Policies, Standards & Implementation \n\nWhat are the existing policies or regulations on this topic? \nAre these aligned with international standards or norms? \nHow do we verify whether these policies are effectively implemented? \nAre there areas where policy does not match practice? \n5. Scale, Urgency & Impact \n\nHow widespread is the problem? \nWhat’s at stake if the problem remains unsolved? \nWhat is the cost (social, financial, political, operational) of inaction? \nHow urgent is the need for change? \n6. Constraints & Risks \n\nWhat social, political, ethical, or operational constraints must be considered? \nAre there geopolitical, environmental, or cultural factors that shape how interventions work? \nWhat internal risk factors should we be aware of before taking action? \n\nReturn the questions in a structured format I can copy into a Word document or download.",
